This doc is to cover our plan for transition plan from previous community NFTs to our new community NFT. To date, we've created five different community NFTs. 

- The Alpha Tester token, created in Fall 2021
- Four token types created in February 2022
    - Trusted Tester
    - Code Contributor
    - Design Contributor 
    - Pawn Shopper

Now that we have a new community NFT that serves as a single place to track all of someone's contributions, we plan to do a one time award of XP and accessories to the holders of these previous tokens.

All previous token holders will give the alpha-snake accessory. All previous token holders will get on XP point in each category––Activity, Contributor, Community––for each NFT they hold. 

Additionally, each Code Contributor and Design Contributor token will warrant an additional 1 Contributor XP, per token. 

### Examples
- Address holds a Trusted Tester token
    - Receives Alpha Snake Accessory, 1 Activiy XP, 1 Community XP, and 1 Contributor XP

- Address holds Alpha Tester token and Pawn Shopper token
    -  Receives Alpha Snake Accessory, 2 Activiy XP, 2 Community XP, and 2 Contributor XP

- Address holds Trusted Tester and Code Contributor
    - Receives Alpha Snake Accessory, 2 Activiy XP, 2 Community XP, and 3 Contributor XP


### How to claim
We will take a snapshot of addresses holding tokens on July 6 and nominate all of these addresses for the accessory and XP they should get, based on the above. The XP and accessory will be nominated to the same address that holds the exisiting community tokens. Recall that the new token is non-transferable (aka "Soulbound"), so if you want to use a different address, you should transfer your community NFTs before July 6. The new community token will exist on Optimism and will be claimable through the Backed interface.
