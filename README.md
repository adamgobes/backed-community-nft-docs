# Backed NFT Docs
The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see past versions on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts). In June 2022, a new Community NFT was created that tracks XP across three categories: Activity, Contributor, and Community, and awards them both automatically (via bots) and through a nomination process. This rubric outlines eligibility for XP rewards: 

<div id="automatically-awarded-xp">
### Automatically Awarded XP
These actions are tracked and logged by bots, reviewed by humans every Friday, and the XP automatically appear on your Community NFT. 

#### Activity XP
- As a lender, provide your first loan
- As a borrower, pay interest on your first loan

#### Contributor XP
- Author a pull request that is merged (start in #dev on Discord)

#### Community XP
- Attend your first community call, Mondays at 11AM EST
- Addional XP with exponential decay: 2nd call, 4th call, 8th, 16th, etc.

### XP Awarded via Nomination Form
Some XP require a nomination process, to limit bots or scams. Once you complete a task or do something noteworthy, nominate yourself (or others!) for XP using the submission form.

#### Activity XP Examples
Nominate yourself for XP for remarkable protocol usage for which there is no automated tracking, such as:
- First ever loan
- Loan with most buyouts

#### Contributor XP
Nominate yourself for XP that help develop the protocol, such as:
- Early-release testing and testnet transactions
- Code reviews on Github
- Design assets used in production
- Smart contract auditing

#### Community XP
Nominate yourself for XP that add your voice to the community, such as:
- Organize a meetup at a conference
- Quality memes
