**Note** [NFT Pawn Shop is now called Backed](https://twitter.com/backed_xyz/status/1506715447051313157?s=20&t=LKYAax1NG-jViKM35Jzzbg) but many of our community NFTs still say "NFT Pawn Shop."

# Backed NFT Docs
The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see them on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts).

The [first NFT type](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb9a069f85d51cc5cf23e910d1a5fd69744e926f1/1) was given out to those who used the product on Rinkeby in fall 2021. 

In February 2022, we decided on some broad categories of community NFTs going forward, and various levels for each category. The current types of NFTs are 
- **Trusted Tester**, given to those who use the product and catch a bug or provide some helpful feedback.
- **Pawn Shopper**, given to those who are active in discord or community calls.
- **Design Community**, given to those who contribute to design conversations and contribute design assets.
- **Code Contributor**, given to those who contribute code that is deployed to production.

New types will be added in the future as there is need. It is expected that each contributor will at most get a unique token/level once, e.g. you cannot get multiple Level 1 Trusted Tester tokens.

We currently have three levels for each type and are working on fully fleshed out definitions. 

#### Trusted Tester
- Level 1 Trusted Tester token, given to community members who tried the product and gave some useful feedback

# FAQ

#### How can I get one?
If you have done activity that qualifies you for one of the tokens, please let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kY84MkKwmk) and we will happily give you a token!

#### Who controls minting? 
Currently wilsoncusack.eth, for convenience. Eventually this will be transferred to a multisig and possibly to the control of the NFT holders themselves. 

#### I have an idea for a new token type
