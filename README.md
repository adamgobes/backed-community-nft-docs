# Backed NFT Docs
The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see past versions on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts). In June 2022, a new Community NFT was created that tracks XP across three categories: Activity, Contributor, and Community, and awards them both automatically (via bots) and through a nomination process. This rubric outlines eligibility for XP rewards: 

### Automatically Awarded XP
These actions are tracked and logged by bots, reviewed by humans every Friday, and the XP automatically appear on your Community NFT. 

#### Activity XP
- As a lender, provide your first loan
- As a borrower, pay interest on your first loan

#### Contributor XP
- Author a pull request that is merged (start in #dev on Discord)

#### Community XP
- Attend your first community call, Mondays at 11AM EST
- Achieve a 4-week streak of community calls

### XP Awarded via Nomination Form
Some XP require a nomination process, to limit bots or scams. Once you complete a task or do something noteworthy, nominate yourself (or others!) for XP using the submission form.

#### Activity XP Examples
Nominate yourself for XP for remarkable protocol usage, such as:
- Lend or borrow the highest loan amount ever

#### Contributor XP
Nominate yourself for XP that help develop the protocol, such as:
- Early-release testing and testnet transactions
- Code reviews on Github
- Design assets used in production
- Smart contract auditing

#### Community XP
Nominate yourself for XP that add your voice to the community, such as:
- Join Backed Discord and follow Backed on Twitter.
- Organize a meetup at a conference
- Quality memes

# FAQ

#### How can I get one?
If you have done activity that qualifies you for one of the tokens, please let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kY84MkKwmk) and we will happily give you a token!

#### Who controls minting? 
Currently wilsoncusack.eth, for convenience. Eventually this will be transferred to a multisig and possibly to the control of the NFT holders themselves. 

#### I have an idea for a new token type
