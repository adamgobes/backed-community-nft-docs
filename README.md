**UPDATE APRIL 19, 2022: WE HAVE PAUSED MINTING TOKENS UNTIL WE CAN MIGRATE TO A NEW COMMUNITY NFT CONTRACT**

**Note** [NFT Pawn Shop is now called Backed](https://twitter.com/backed_xyz/status/1506715447051313157?s=20&t=LKYAax1NG-jViKM35Jzzbg) but many of our community NFTs still say "NFT Pawn Shop."

# Backed NFT Docs
The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see them on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts).

The [first NFT type](https://opensea.io/assets/0xb9a069f85d51cc5cf23e910d1a5fd69744e926f1/1) was given out to those who used the product on Rinkeby in fall 2021. 

In February 2022, we decided on some broad categories of community NFTs going forward, and various levels for each category. Those types of NFTs were: 
- **Trusted Tester**, given to those who use the product and catch a bug or provide some helpful feedback.
- **Pawn Shopper**, given to those who are active in discord or community calls.
- **Design Community**, given to those who contribute to design conversations and contribute design assets.
- **Code Contributor**, given to those who contribute code that is deployed to production.

In June 2022, we migrated to a new Community NFT that tracks XP across three categories: Activity, Contributor, and Community, and awards them both automatically (via bots) and through a nomination process. This rubric outlines eligibility for XP rewards: 

### Automatically Awarded XP

#### Activity XP
- As a lender, provide your first loan (+1XP for 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th)
- As a borrower, pay interest on your first loan (+1XP for 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th)

#### Contributor XP
- Merge a PR (start in #dev on Discord)

#### Community XP
- Attend your first community call, Mondays at 11AM EST
- Achieve a 4-week streak of community calls

### XP Awarded via Nomination Form

#### Activity XP Examples
Nominate yourself for XP for remarkable protocol usage, such as:
- Lend or borrow the highest loan amount ever
- Use a Noun as collateral

#### Contributor XP
Nominate yourself for XP that help develop the protocol, such as:
- Early-release testing and testnet transactions
- Code reviews on Github
- Design assets used in production
- Contract auditing

#### Community XP
Nominate yourself for XP that add your voice to the community, such as:
- Join Backed Discord and follow Backed on Twitter.
- Organize a meetup at an conference
- Quality memes

# FAQ

#### How can I get one?
If you have done activity that qualifies you for one of the tokens, please let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kY84MkKwmk) and we will happily give you a token!

#### Who controls minting? 
Currently wilsoncusack.eth, for convenience. Eventually this will be transferred to a multisig and possibly to the control of the NFT holders themselves. 

#### I have an idea for a new token type
